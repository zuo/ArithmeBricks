How to install and run
----------------------

Installation is typical for applications based on the Kivy
library: download Kivy and follow the instructions for your
particular platform - see: http://kivy.org/#download

Up to now, the game has been tested on Linux (and superficially
on Android) but let's hope it works on other platforms as well.
(That was the intention.) :)

The main script/program of the game is, naturally, the *main.py*
file.


How to play
-----------

Use the slider at the bottom of the screen to choose the difficulty
level; then press the *New game*/*Play more* button.

Drag and drop the bricks (digits and operators) to form one or more
valid equalities, such as *2+10=15-3*.  All given bricks must be
used.  There is always at least one valid solution.
